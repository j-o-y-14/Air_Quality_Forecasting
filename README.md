# Air_Quality_Forecasting
Air Quality Classification
# Problem Statement

Air pollution (PM2.5, NO‚ÇÇ) harms health, causing respiratory and cardiovascular diseases.

People need clear AQI categories (Good, Moderate, Unhealthy, Hazardous) instead of raw pollutant numbers.

Lack of timely forecasts limits prevention and response.

Goal: Use ML classification to predict AQI categories for early warnings and better public health decisions.

# Overview

This project applies machine learning classification models to predict Air Quality Index (AQI) categories (Good, Moderate, Unhealthy, Hazardous) based on real-world pollutant data.

We use the OpenAQ API to collect air quality measurements (PM2.5, NO‚ÇÇ) and transform them into health-relevant classes. The goal is to provide an early-warning tool for citizens and health authorities.

 # Objectives

Collect real-time air quality data (PM2.5, NO‚ÇÇ) using the OpenAQ API.

Engineer features (time of day, lags, rolling averages).

Train classification models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting).

Evaluate performance with Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score.

Provide insights into which features influence AQI most.
